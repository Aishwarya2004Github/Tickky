This project has been a fantastic way to hone my frontend development skills, and I added a few cool features to make it more interactive:

ðŸŽ‰ Dynamic Wallpapers: Players can choose from different backgrounds, adding a personalized touch to the game.
ðŸŽ‰ 1-Player and 2-Player Modes: Whether you're challenging yourself against the computer or competing with a friend, this game has you covered.
ðŸŽ‰ Text-to-Speech Feature: Type anything in the input box, click the 'Speak' button, and hear it spoken aloud. It's a fun way to add another layer of interaction to the game!

Developing this game was a great learning experience, especially in implementing game logic, responsive design, and user interaction. I'm proud of how it turned out and excited to keep pushing the boundaries of what I can create with code!
